And we're **LIVE**! 

Welcome to openTenancy. We made this with two goals in mind: 

1. To make tenancy rights simple to understand through an easy questionnaire. 
2. To make our product accessible to all by making it open source. 

We're inviting you to have a look at our MVP, right now we're focusing just on repairs - with the aim to expanding once we get some feedback. 

Have a look and let us know what you think. We're excited to see openTenancy grow. 

Your founders, 

Amy and Ana x
