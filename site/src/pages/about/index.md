  Who We Are

## Who we are

We are two ambitious MSc Computer Science students interested in helping students learn more about their rights as tenants in the UK. We were tired of having to jump around a number of websites to learn about the treatment we are legally entitled to as tenants. So, we decided to do something about it. 

## Why openTenancy?

Because you deserve the chance to enforce your rights as a tenant, and ensure that you get the most out of your tenancy. We believe that the key to a good legal system is one that is open and accessible. Confusing legal terminology, or pages and pages of statutes should not stop someone from learning about what they are legally entitled to.  

## Want to get involved? 

That's great! Visit us on github to see what we're currently working on. If you notice an issue that we've missed, or have suggestions more legal content, create an issue on github or - if you want to dive in - feel free to create a PR with your suggested changes. 

## The tech

openTenancy is completely open source and free to use. We are built using Docassemble and GatsbyJS, and run on Netlify.
